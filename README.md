# The impact of SNP density on quantitative genetic analyses of body size traits in a wild population of Soay sheep
Scripts and input data for James et. al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.483376)

### We politely request that you do not use this data without contacting the Soay sheep research project first at j.pemberton@ed.ac.uk . This paper is part of an ongoing long-term study on the Soay population, thus the data here is an archived version and is missing more recently caught individuals. In addition, it is possible that the research you are considering with this data is already underway (or already published) - contacting us beforehand would allow for coordination of research. Thank you

Analyses are grouped by trait/age class. Adult trait folders include files for the two-step GWAS approach, and traits we performed conditional analysis on also include these files. 

Three traits (adult August weight, adult foreleg length and adult hindleg length) are repeatability models - these traits have additional scripts to create the reformatted .ped file for these analyses. Phenotype and fixed + random effect files are already formatted for the repeatability model format.
