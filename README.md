# Impact_of_SNPDensity_on_Soay_Sheep
Scripts and input data for James et. al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.483376)

Analyses are grouped by trait/age class. Adult trait folders include files for the two-step GWAS approach, and traits we performed conditional analysis on also include these files. 

Three traits (adult August weight, adult foreleg length and adult hindleg length) are repeatability models - these traits have additional scripts to create the reformatted .ped file for these analyses. Phenotype and fixed + random effect files are already formatted for the repeatability model format.
