# SOAY SHEEP DATA REUSE:

## The attached files contain data derived from the long term field project monitoring individual Soay sheep on St Kilda and their environment.  This is a request to please let us know if you use them.  Several people have spent the best part of their careers collecting the data.  If you plan to analyse the data, there are a number of reasons why it would be very helpful if you could contact Dan Nussey (dan.nussey@ed.ac.uk) before doing so.

## [NB. If you are interested in analysing the detailed project data in any depthÂ you may find it helpful to have our full relational database rather than the file(s) available here.  If so, then we have a simple process for bringing you onto the project as a collaborator.]

## 1) The data can be subject to change due to updates in the pedigree, merging of records, occasional errors and so on.

## 2) The data are complex and workers who do not know the study system may benefit from advice when interpreting it.

## 3) At any one time a number of people within the existing project collaboration are analysing data from this project. Someone else may already be conducting the analysis you have in mind and it is desirable to prevent duplication of effort.

## 4) In order to maintain funding for the project(s), every few years we have to write proposals for original analyses to funding agencies. It is therefore very helpful for those running the project to know what data analyses are in progress.

## 5) Individual identifiers may vary relative to other data archives from papers using the individual-level data.

# The impact of SNP density on quantitative genetic analyses of body size traits in a wild population of Soay sheep
Scripts and input data for James et. al (https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.07.483376)

Analyses are grouped by trait/age class. Adult trait folders include files for the two-step GWAS approach, and traits we performed conditional analysis on also include these files. 

Three traits (adult August weight, adult foreleg length and adult hindleg length) are repeatability models - these traits have additional scripts to create the reformatted .ped file for these analyses. Phenotype and fixed + random effect files are already formatted for the repeatability model format.
